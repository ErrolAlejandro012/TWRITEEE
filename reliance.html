            <h1>Over Reliance of Humans with Artificial Intelligence</h1>
            <p class="blog-meta">Published on: January 5, 2025 | Author: Gian Nino Sawal</p>
            <p class="blog-description">Artificial Intelligence, the epitome of modern-day evolution and revolution on how people live and work. For many, it has been such a blessing for us to have access in these such things as it can literally make our daily lives and tasks so much easier which gives convenience to many. Our daily lives are increasingly incorporating artificial intelligence (AI).  </p>

        <p>AI is already significantly changing how we live and work, from smartphones to self-driving automobiles. It has become an integral part of daily lives of many. Furthermore, our reliance on AI is only going to increase as it develops further. As good as it sounds like, people nowadays over-rely on AI. Tasks like writing essays or statements, which we can easily do ourselves, are now being done by AI, tasks that we normally do in our own, we choose to rely on AI.</p>

        <p>But first, what is Artificial Intelligence or AI? Artificial intelligence is the technology that gives computer and device capabilities for simulating the other human abilities such as learning and understanding, problem-solving, decision-making, creativity, and autonomy-that allow machines to perform tasks that usually require the intelligence of humans. Artificial intelligence is traced to ancient myths and fables of intelligent automatons, thinking devices, but it was only in the mid-20th century with the development of electronic computers that the concept could be hoisted. John McCarthy coined the term "Artificial Intelligence" in 1956, which led to the programming of the first AI language, LISP, during the 1960s. Most early systems used rule-based logic techniques, which prompted the development of greater systems in the 1970s and 1980s, a milestone era with rising research funding and technological breakthroughs.</p>

        <p>Now knowing what is AI and its history, is it helpful or a hindrance to humanity? Are we now starting to over rely on it? In my opinion, yes, Artificial Intelligence is a huge blessing for many of us at it does the long work for all of us. Before, when we want to search for something, we must search it first in a search engine such as Google to find what we are trying to find but now, all we have to say is “Siri” or “Alexa” and our questions and tasks will be answered. It became very convenient for all of us that sometimes, we forget on how to work as humans. </p>

        <p>One of the biggest problems with artificial intelligence is human laziness, along with its complementing adversities of bias, lack of privacy, and job loss. Automation will displace under- and unskilled workers and capture a great deal of work from workers in most spheres from factory laborers to high-end professions like doctors and lawyers. Automated services substitute for both elephants and beans in increasing numbers today. AI systems, which many people regularly use now, bring ease and encourage their dependence on their use by taking away any potential for much effort, critical thinking, and innovation that may have been earlier involved in carrying out many tasks. Since people keep assigning work and level of decision-making to the AI, the critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving capabilities of thinking humans are made lesser or none for some situations that would need human judgment and innovation. Bias often transferred from human-created datasets into AI systems begets discriminatory results. For instance, a tool created for hiring at Amazon was programmed based on male-dominated history data, which ended up being decommissioned because it was found discriminatory against women, thereby sustaining oppression. The huge amount of data that needs to be processed by AI systems exposes users to threats regarding privacy and security and personal data is collected by companies without employee consent. The same data are also susceptible to breaches and can be used by hackers for nefarious purposes such as identity theft. These are some of the serious concerns that make both the morally responsible development and governance of AI imperative in reducing the negative effects of this technology on society.</p>

        <p>AI is a powerful tool for us and what we must do is to adapt to it because we have no choice but to have to. The key takeaway is we must not over rely on it and make it our own master. Jobs will be displaced, and people will get lazier overtime if we continue this trend. We must keep our creativity and creative thinking alive and not depend everything on AI. Overall, we must use is wisely and smartly. </p>
