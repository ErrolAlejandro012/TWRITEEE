            <h1>Top Cybersecurity Threats in 2024 and How to Stay Safe</h1>
            <p class="blog-meta">Published on: January 5, 2025 | Author: Errol Alejandro</p>
            <p class="blog-description">In today's hyper-connected world, cybersecurity threats are more prevalent than ever. With the rise of hackers infiltrating systems, sensitive data and critical infrastructure are at risk. This analysis will explore the major cybersecurity threats faced by individuals and organizations, while offering strategies to stay secure in the digital landscape.</p>

        <h1>Here are some Cybersecurity threats and how to be safe against them:</h1>
        <p><strong>1. Ransomware 2.0:</strong> Threat hacking and cryptography no longer cover the full threat landscape of ransomware attack levels. </p>

        <p><strong>Double extortion: </strong> Attackers steal data as evidence before encrypting it for ransom, the ransom not paid, and threaten to make the sensitive data public at a certain time. </p>

        <p><strong>Supply chain attack: </strong>Cybercriminals concentrate on important suppliers of software. They will breach the suppliers' systems and then infect the downstream customers. </p>

        <p><strong>Healthcare and Critical Infrastructure: </strong>Attacks on hospitals and essential services create a grave situation because patients are left unattended and public safety is disturbed. </p>

        <h1>How to Stay Safe?</h1>
        <p><strong>Have strong data backup: </strong>perform periodic critical data backups on offline storage devices and secure these backups.</p>

        <p><strong>Enhance your defenses:</strong>Regular software patches, super firewalls, and multi-factor authentication. </p>

        <p><strong>Cybersecurity insurance: </strong>Think about buying cybersecurity insurance for financial losses during attacks. </p>


        <h1>2. Breaches in Cloud Security:</h1>
        <p><strong>The Threat:</strong>The more businesses join the clouds, the broader the attack surface.</p>

        <p><strong>Misconfiguration: </strong>A misconfiguration of cloud service will lead sensitive information to vast holes and openings that serve as a vulnerability.</p>


        <p><strong>Insider threats: </strong>Employees granted access to cloud resources may unintentionally or intentionally misuse the privileges assigned to them.</p>


        <p><strong>Usual third-party risk:</strong>Data breaches at the provider level add another layer of risk in the cloud sourcing scenario.</p>


        <h1>How to Stay Safe?</h1>
        <p><strong>Staying Safe:</strong>Cloud security posture management: Regular assessment and enhancement of your cloud security posture. </p>

        <p><strong>Impose strong access control:</strong>Least privilege access and utterly strong authentication for cloud resources. </p>

        <p><strong>Renewal of the audit:</strong>Cloud usage should include suspect activity monitoring, facilitating the timely investigation of possible anomalies.</p>

        <p>Humans always have the thought of not being safe, especially in the digital world. We cannot see some things because we need to be knowledgeable on those, we are constantly overwhelmed by what we see on the internet. Some Cybersecurity threats have the idea to fool what you already know then using that idea to make you attempt to do something but in turn you just helped them hack into your computer. So, with these threats that we discussed we are giving the idea and the knowledge to be careful when engaging with people on the internet, especially the applications that they share with you. Having the correct knowledge is also having the right idea of what to do to avoid these threats. It may look complicated, but we must understand first what it means and what it does to have the right way to avoid those.</p>
